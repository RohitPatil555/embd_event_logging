  Implement a three‑state machine for each packet: 
    <br>• Empty – ready to accept new events.
    <br>• InUse – currently collecting events.
    <br>• ReadyToSend – fully populated and queued for transmission. 
  The state transitions are:
    <br>- Empty → InUse when an event is added.
    <br>- InUse → ReadyToSend when the packet buffer is full.
    <br>- ReadyToSend → Empty after successful transmission.
